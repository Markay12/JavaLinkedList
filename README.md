## **_About Me_**
At the time of writing this program I am a Freshman at Arizona State University studing Computer Systems Engineering in my second semester. Due to the recent events of COVID-19 and complications with living at home and working on all classes from home I have extra time to work on these programs and develop a more understandable version of programs that I have developed.\
Hopefully all explanations here work... if not feel free to contact me at:\

## **_Program Information_**
This program displays a menu of _choices_ which allows the user to develop a list\
Once this list is developed the user can perform operations on this list which are provided\
\
**Choices**
```Java

"A Add String"
"C Count Strings"
"D Duplicate Each"
"H How Many Appear Before"
"I Index Of Last"
"L List Strings"
"Q Quit"
"R Remove from Even Indices"
"S Remove String at some Index"
"? Display Help"

```


## **_Data Structures_**
To understand LinkedLists you must first understand data structures and how they are used within lists\
\
### **Static Vs. Dynamic Data Structures**
* A _static_ data structure has a fixed size (Arrays) `int[] numbers = new int[size]`
* _Dynamic_ data structures grow and shrink as required by the information it contains (LinkedLists)

\
An object _reference_ is a var that stores the address of an object\
A reference is also called a _pointer_\
Object references can be used to create _links_ between objects
