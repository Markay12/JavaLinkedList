## **_About Me_**
At the time of writing this program I am a Freshman at Arizona State University studing Computer Systems Engineering in my second semester. Due to the recent events of COVID-19 and complications with living at home and working on all classes from home I have extra time to work on these programs and develop a more understandable version of programs that I have developed.\
Hopefully all explanations here work... if not feel free to contact me at:\
